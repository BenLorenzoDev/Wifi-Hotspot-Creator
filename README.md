# Wifi-Hotspot-Creator
Java powered wifi hotspot creator for windows [haven't tried on other platforms]. This was my final project for CS50x [an online course of edX]. This app is written in Java and JavaFX.

## Why it is different than other available softwares?
* It has a Wifi Device Checker which can check your wifi device status and if the proper driver is installed in your pc
* Since you have to configure your shared net once, you don't have to worry next time

## How to use?
* Go to `Network and Sharing Center`
* Click on `Change adapter settings`
* Right click on the adapter from which you use internet, click `Properties` then on the `Sharing` tab tick on the `Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection` and choose the wifi adapter and you're good to go.
